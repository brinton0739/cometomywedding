  ## Description
  Welcome to the Wedding Loop! A mock app that users can sign up and create a wedding invitation and invite friends and family to their wedding with a unique code.  When users redeem the code they get to see the wedding information, add photos to the wedding album, see the guest list, and sign the guest book. The user who created the wedding, will get to see who RSVP'd to their wedding, edit their wedding event info, see the wedding photos, and upload their own photos, and read the guestbook messages.  This app was created as a group project.<br>
  We used the following to create the Wedding Loop:
  - Figma (to design and wireframe)
  - Adobe Illustrator (logo and images)
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Mysql and Sequelize
  - AWS s3 (host photos)
  - crypto (helper to create image URL's)
  - bcrypt (for password hashing)
  - uuid (create codes)
  - handlebars (for views)
  - connect session (for cookies)


  ## Usage
  This application is deployed live  [here](https://limitless-journey-28555.herokuapp.com/). <br>
  You can sign up for an account and create your own wedding. If you would like trying to RSVP to a wedding and upload a photo to their wedding album, use the RSVP code `3DDB8B` on the rsvp page.
 

  ## Installation
   You can run this program by creating your own .env file and gecreate your own credientials for a AWS S3 bucket
